# Introduction

### Thanks for wanting to help the BackChannel project!

These guidelines will help keep this project organized and make managing issues and features easier for all contributors.
The BackChannel Client was started and is managed by [one developer](https://github.com/EpsiRho). Any help with features, bugs, and documentation are very much appreciated.

### What to help with

* Bug reporting
* Bug Fixing
* Feature requests (Must be done with a code demo!)
* Feature completion (Writing code that could be introduced in the client)
* Improving Documentation

# Ground Rules

* Before writing any code, make an issue to request a feature. Create a discussion and get community feedback.
* When writing code for the BackChannel Client keep in mind that as of now this is only designed to run on Windows. While in the future we may look into other platforms, it wont be in this repository.
* When adding features, keep pull requests to one new / changed feature.
  * This also goes for bug fixed, try to keep it to one bug fix per PR.
* As this is being written in C#, make sure to follow the [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions).
* Code must be properly commented.

# Making a Pull Request

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from  this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://kcd.im/pull-request) 

Issues that need help will be labeled [as such](https://github.com/BackChannel-Chat-Client/BackChannel-Client/labels/help%20wanted). If you're new to contributing to open source projects, try an issue labeled [good first issue](https://github.com/BackChannel-Chat-Client/BackChannel-Client/labels/good%20first%20issue). 

When making your pull request, make sure to document your changes and why they were changed well.

# Reporting Bugs

### Reporting Security vulnerabilities

**If you find a security vulnerability, do *NOT* Open an issue. Instead message me directly through [Email](mailto:epsirho@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EpsilonRho)**. Security issues are taken very seriously, and are top priority when fixing anything. 

### Reporting any other kind of bug

Reporting bugs on GitHub is very easy, as the template is one of the options you have when creating an issue. Just follow the template guidelines and you should be fine.

# Suggesting a features or enhancements

Before suggesting anything, look through our issues list and see if anyone else has thought of the same thing first. The less duplicate issues the better.

As this is an open source project, we want to make sure the community behind it is on board with changes and features, so before writing any code please make an issue discussing the change and optionally some mockups or MS Paint drawings to get your point across. Thanks to GitHub, there is a template to use when creating an issue, so please use it.
